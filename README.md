- 👋 Hi, I’m @andyschauer.
- 👀 I’m interested in isotope geochemistry, data, accuracy, science, less monotony with coding, and coffee.
- 🌱 I hope to always be learning. Right now my focus is python, git, and CRDS guts. Next up, C, R, and &Delta;<sub>48</sub>.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate. Collaboration is the only way we are going to get this done.
- 📫 How to reach me - right here on github
